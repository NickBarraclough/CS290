		<h1>Nicolas Barraclough (Nick)</h1>
		<h2>barracln@oregonstate.edu</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>I am majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Game and Simulation.</li>
				<li>1 out of 10. I've played around a bit with "Inspect Page" but had no idea what I was doing.</li>
				<li>I am very excited to build my own website from scratch. I hope to learn what it takes to make an engaging, effective website.</li>
				<li>Yes, I have signed up for Piazza.</li>
				<li>One interesting thing about me is that I played college baseball. After baseball, I thought I was going to major in Kinesiology,
					but I quickly realised that I didn't have a passion for that path. Then a friend of mine introduced me to his world of computer science
					and so with little to no background knowledge of CS, I switched my major. I love learning CS and I think I have found a career path that I will enjoy because of it.</li>
				<li>I don't take a lot of pictures of just myself, so please enjoy this picture of my girlfriend, Makenzie, and I at a Seattle Mariners game.</li>
